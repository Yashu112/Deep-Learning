    "Q1. What is an activation function in the context of artificial neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. An activation function in the context of artificial neural networks is a crucial component of a perceptron within a neural network. It determines the output of the perceptron(artificial neuron) based on its input. It is used to dsetermine the output of neuron based on input.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q2. What are some common types of activation functions used in neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Here are some common Types of Activation Functions:\n",
    "- **Sigmoid**: The sigmoid function produces an output in the range (0, 1). It was commonly used in the past for binary classification problems.\n",
    "- **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)**: The tanh function produces an output in the range (-1, 1). It is similar to the sigmoid but centered at zero, making it zero-centered and better for training.\n",
    "- **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**: ReLU is the most widely used activation function. It returns zero if the input is less than zero and the input itself if it's positive, making it computationally efficient.\n",
    "- **Leaky ReLU**: Leaky ReLU is a modification of ReLU where it allows a small gradient when the input is less than zero, preventing the \"dying ReLU\" problem.\n",
    "- **Parametric ReLU (PReLU)**: Similar to Leaky ReLU, but with a learnable parameter for controlling the slope of the negative side.\n",
    "- **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)**: ELU is a variant of ReLU that has a non-zero gradient for negative inputs. It helps mitigate some of the issues with ReLU.\n",
    "- **Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU)**: SELU is a self-normalizing activation function, designed to maintain a fixed mean and variance throughout the network."

    "Q3. How do activation functions affect the training process and performance of a neural network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Activation functions have a significant impact on the training process and performance of a neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-linearity and Model Capacity**: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the neural network. This non-linearity is crucial for the network's ability to learn and represent complex, non-linear relationships in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient Flow and Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**: During the training process, gradients are used to update the network's weights through backpropagation. The shape of the activation function affects how gradients flow backward through the network.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Dead Neurons**: Dead neurons are neurons that never activate (produce an output of zero) for any input during training. This can occur when using ReLU and all inputs to a neuron are negative. Activation functions like Leaky ReLU or Parametric ReLU can prevent this issue by allowing a small gradient for negative inputs, ensuring that neurons continue to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convergence Speed**: The choice of activation function can affect how quickly a neural network converges during training. Functions with gentle slopes near the origin, like sigmoid and tanh, may lead to slower convergence due to small gradients. In contrast, ReLU and its variants often lead to faster convergence because they provide stronger gradients for positive inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Efficiency and Computational Resources**: The computational efficiency of activation functions is an essential consideration, especially when training large neural networks.\n"

Its main purpose is to transform the raw output scores, often referred to as logits, from the final layer of a neural network into a probability distribution over multiple classes. The softmax function accomplishes this by exponentiating and normalizing the scores, ensuring that the output values sum to 1.\n",
